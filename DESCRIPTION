Description: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data
    sets by Batsch et al. (2008) <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-9-95>. This package
    provides five data sets, one for each PCR target: (i) rat SLC6A14,
    (ii) human SLC22A13, (iii) pig EMT, (iv) chicken ETT, and (v) human
    GAPDH. Each data set comprises a five-point, four-fold dilution series.
    For each concentration there are three replicates. Each amplification curve
    is 45 cycles long. Original raw data file:
